# Classic Memory Game In C#

## Welcome to our project! This is a C# implementation of the classic memory game. The game includes a command-line interface and allows for both player-vs-player and player-vs-computer game modes.

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your machine using git clone. 
2. Open the project in a C# IDE (like Visual Studio). 
3. Build the project and run (Please ensure you have .NET Core installed on your machine).


To play the game, follow the on-screen instructions provided by the command-line interface:

Choose the game mode (Player vs. Player or Player vs. Computer). Enter your moves as prompted by the CLI. In Player vs. Computer mode, the AI uses a computer memory to choose the best next move.
